The Morse Code Translator application is a Python tool that allows you to convert text to Morse code and vice versa. Morse code is a telecommunications character encoding scheme that uses dots and dashes to represent text characters as sequences of two different signal durations. This application has a menu-based interface with options to translate Morse code to English, Morse code to English, and exit the application.
